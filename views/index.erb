	<p>You’re on your way back from a party on Halloween night.  You’re 10 minutes away from breaking curfew.  There’s no way you’ll make it home on time if you Uber.  You need to take a shortcut.  You walk ahead into the woods clutching a broken flashlight and a bag of fun-sized candy, almost as if you are in a trance (maybe that last drink wasn’t such a good idea).  It’s dark in there--so dark you can’t even tell if your eyes are open or shut. To the West, you hear rustling in the bushes.  To the East, you see a light beam.  Which way do you turn?</p>
