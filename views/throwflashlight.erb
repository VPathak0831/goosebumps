	<h4> You hit the raccoon, and it runs away. Yay! The flashlight bounces off of the raccoon and turns on, illuminating a new path. You realize you shouldâ€™ve checked the battery sooner, but then again, you realize you were just drunk. You follow the new path for 15 minutes and realize you are back in town. A police car shows up, and they take you to the station for breaking curfew. Go back and try again.  </h4>
